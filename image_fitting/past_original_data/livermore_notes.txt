1/23:

TO DO For 1/24

Ask James and Paul if Mark can join our Wed 11 am meeting this week

TO do for spikes:

Get fitting working
--add ACS background, photon noise + other error sources
(ghosts/the cuspy thing)

For Milli 2017 on HD 206893 :: calculate astrometric amplitude



Other topics:
-Putting thorough research plans together
-BP should be doable now. Get reasonable tests of my spikefitting.
-Other objects need GAIA end-of-year data for higher precision on 
reference stars (case in point, HD206893)
-MCMC :: verifying independence of relative & absolute params
       + getting MCMC to converge in a reasonable time in
       high-dimentional parameter spaces
       + unbiased estimators for orbital params
       + general analysis of orbital sampling: MCMC vs OFTI,
           observation cadence, period fraction needed in
           different geometries, different orbital families
       + bound vs unbound orbit fits
-Spikefits::
--Thorough comparison bw Tiny Tim and PROPER and real data
----add ghosts, photon noise, read noise, other sources of background
--Verify that spikefitting accurately centers star, regardless of
  any chromatic or field-dependent effect
--Verify that spikefitting + centroiding can yield good astrometry
  of ref stars AND target stars together
